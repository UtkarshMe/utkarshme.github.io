Okay, it's been a while since I last wrote. I got a little busy with my acads
is all. But not to worry because I have a new project at hand! Woohoo! And it's
finally what I really like to do; low level shiz and not WebDev.

Enough beating around the bush, let me introduce you to, 'A Vim Story', the new
best way to learn [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). The idea is to make a game out of
it and let the user enjoy the steep learning curve, rather than dread it like I
did. There is nothing concrete yet but I'm a little inclined towards using the
[GNU CLib](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), particularly ncurses. The
project will feature many levels like an old console game (eg. bomberman) which
can be passed only by using the vim keys and commands, taking learn by doing to
a whole new level. Stay tuned for more updates!
