It was a pain in the ass, logging into the internet portal again and again and
again. A script was needed and it was needed badly. Presenting the
[BitsnetLogin v1.0.0](https://github.com/OSDLabs/BitsnetLogin/releases/tag/1.0.0).
A complete cli program in itself with a launcher app. The options in the
current release include (but are notÂ limited to) logging into the Hostel LAN
and WiFi and Academic block wifi. The app is designed for unix/linux based
systems only for the moment. Windows compatible app should be in line. So next
time you want to log into the bitsnet, don't open a browser, open a terminal.
