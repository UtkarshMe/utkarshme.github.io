So the customary **Hello world**Â was in line. There. I said it. The program
seems to be working fine. Anyway, this first post is basically for describing
what and why. The motivation and reason for this is not a very grand one, but
nonetheless important. This blog serves as a journal, for me and for whoever it
may concern, of stuff I explore and venture into during my days on this planet
(and any other planet). I'll keep it as close to coding and programming as I
can but that's not really a compulsion. I guess that is what blogging is.
'Logging' your memories, feelings and experiences. That being said, I promise
(to myself and the audience) that this is not going to be your everyday blog
but a little different and interesting. Wish me luck!
