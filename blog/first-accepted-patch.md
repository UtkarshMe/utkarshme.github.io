This is so damn exciting! My code is going into the awesome repositories of
Gnome! I have always dreamt of coding for something big, something significant
and this was the first successful attempt. It was for the
[Gnome Todo](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Todo) app which I use on a daily
basis. I never thought I would one day get to add something to it! Although the
[bug](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777551) was really minor and
required a one-line change, the feeling and later the
[comment](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=777551#c7) of the
maintainer (Sweet and short. Looks good!), was more than enough for me. This
has somehow increased my desire to code for open source even more (if that was
possible) and ten-folded my love for open source. I submitted two more patches
for [Gnome Calendar](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Calendar) and I can't stop
myself from checking out the bug page every few hours! So I'm off to see if
there's anything new...
