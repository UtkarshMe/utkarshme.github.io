The new OS is in! Welcome, *drumrolls* **Elementary OS 0.4 Loki.** It was a
hard decision really, leaving all the customizability of Ubuntu and switching
to the somewhat constricted Loki. But the best part about it is that Loki
doesn't require that amount of customization. The UI looks, and feels, like a
Mac but there are a few differences here and there. Actually, there are many.
Nonetheless, being built from Ubuntu, the transition wasn't much a difference,
except for the escape from the Unity look that bored me to death.

Even though it's built on Gnome 3, it's faster and less glitchy than the same.
The Gnome extensions are the one thing that would have
been better if implemented but I'm not complaining. The GTK+3 apps integrate
with the system beautifully, unlike Unity which still hasn't fixed this issue.
The OS promises great speed while offering a great deal of eye candy at the
same time. For example, the applications drawer (Slingshot) is faster than
Unity Dash and Gnome overview by a great deal. Workspaces are dynamic and
arranged horizontally, like you would see in a Mac. Even though I could not get
multitouch gestures working (yet), the workspace switching process is fast and
lets me stay productive.

So... I will be spending quite some time on this OS, toying around with it.
Catch you later!
