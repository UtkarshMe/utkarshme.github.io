So I had enough of Gnome breaking every now and then, filling up my RAM with
all sorts of unwanted services and decided to switch to something new. I wanted
something that would reduce the whole dependency cycle; something which does
not make you choose between eye-candy and performance.

And [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) caught my eye, which claims to be "targeted at
advanced users and developers." I looked around for some screenshots for how
does it look and was surprised to find that every one of them was drastically
different from the other.

I3wm is a tiling manager and not a desktop environment which makes it lighter
and thus faster than Gnome or KDE or any other desktop environment.

The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/i3) page is pretty well
written and gets you started with enough information to get it up and running.
The [docs](https://i3wm.org/docs/) page of i3wm is quite rich and provides all
you need to know to fully configure your desktop. _The only limit is your
creativity!_

Here's what the setup looks like:<br>

I would recommend using [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) which is a
fork of i3 with some enhancements like the gaps between windows.

What I have come to love about i3 is how fast I can navigate between windows. I
hate using my touchpad unless absolutely necessary and that is exactly what i3
eliminated. I don't have to even think about it and all work is done by my
muscle memory. I have my key bindings close to Vim which makes the task even
more easier.

I have put all the setup configuration
[here](https://github.com/coditva/i3-config). Because I am never satisfied
with a configuration (hehe), I will keep updating it till I don't switch to
another display manager.
